    <h2>HOW TO PLAY:</h2>
    <p>ROLE MODEL 2048 is a musically-themed version of the classic puzzle game 2048. In 
        this version, combine tiles featuring his albums, singles, and EPs to progress
        through his discography to his latest release: Kansas Anymore (The Longest Goodbye).</p>
    <p>Just like the original 2048, combine matching tiles by pressing the arrow keys on your 
        keyboard to slide them in that direction. When two identical tiles collide, they merge into
        a new one representing the next level. Keep going until you unlock all 11 covers!</p>

    <!-- implementing guide later: i want it to be like a music player where skipping shows the next level, etc. -->
