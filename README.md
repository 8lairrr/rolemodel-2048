# 🎵 ROLE MODEL 2048

A musically-themed version of the classic 2048 puzzle game — inspired by the discography of ROLE MODEL. Instead of merging numbers, players combine tiles featuring album art, EPs, and singles to progress through his musical journey, culminating in his latest release: *Kansas Anymore (The Longest Goodbye)*.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Language | Why It Was Used |
|----------|------------------|
| **HTML** | Structured the game layout and page content with semantic elements |
| **CSS**  | Designed a cohesive and responsive UI with custom tile styles and layout behavior |
| **JavaScript** | Handled all interactive logic: tile movement, merging, score tracking, and game state management. Gave me flexibility to learn and experiment throughout development |
